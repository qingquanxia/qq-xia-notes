    "text": "Hello! My name is QingQuan Xia.\nI am a Christian who is saved through grace by the Lord Jesus Christ and holds that the Bible is the perfect literal word of God.\nI graduated from UC Berkeley in 2022 as an Engineering Physics and EECS major, and then worked at SpaceX as a software engineer on the Direct-to-cell Starlink team for 3 years, writing code for the PHY/MAC layers of the 4G LTE protocol. However, because I really like doing physics, I’m applying for a PhD as of Nov 2025.\nThere are many mathematical tools I’ve learned and honed over the years that I want to gather in one place. As I continue to learn things, I’m planning to write them down as notes on this website so that I can refer back to them in the future and hopefully benefit a few others as well."
